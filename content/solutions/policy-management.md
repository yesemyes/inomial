You make the rules and how they are enforced.

As Smile software collects and tracks network usage in real time via RADIUS, SNMP, Netflow or external means, it can apply policy management in real time. Your end-users can be issued alerts when they reach defined levels of usage.

When defined levels have been reached Smile will apply your policy actions.

Policy can be based on:

<ul>
	<li>plan</li>
	<li>time of day, day or week, date</li>
	<li>usage, including multiple service usage aggregation, peak and off-peak</li>
</ul>

Policy can be multiple, complex rules. Smile billing supports multiple network policies and automatic policy ranking and resolution. Simple messaging interfaces enable easy, vendor-neutral integration with your network.

Actions that can be taken include:

<ul>
	<li>bandwidth shaping</li>
	<li>throttling or reduction of service access</li>
	<li>call barring</li>
</ul>
