Smile softwareâ€™s integrated Helpdesk and CRM workflow system captures tickets directly from customers or any number of email boxes, and assigns the tickets to staff members (or groups of staff) for action. The built-in workflow manager allows for the implementation of simple manual workflows including escalation, inventory fulfilment, truck rolls, appointment management, multi-step on-boarding, and much more.

Notifications can be configured within your workflows to keep your customers up to date with their order or issue, as well as their spend or service usage. Internal notifications can be set to advise your staff of new orders or serve changes, appointments or customer issues.

Workflow management allows easy interaction with dispatch centres via email or other means. Inomial can also provide and integrate with third party warehouse inventory systems if you are managing your own inventory.
