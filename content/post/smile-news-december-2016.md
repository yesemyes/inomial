<td align="left" valign="top"><strong>Reflections on 2016</strong><p></p>
<p>December is a great time to enjoy a look back at the year that was. For Inomial, 2016 was a year of big changes.</p>
<p>For me personally, the most important event of the year was having my long time mentor, Ian Fry, join Inomial as CEO. After Ian took over day to day responsibilities for the business back in February, I’ve been able to return to what I love — being a huge geek.</p>
<p>When we planned Ian’s move to Inomial, he asked me about job descriptions. I said his job is to “Build a great business”; mine is to “Build a great product”. We’re both working very hard towards these goals.</p>
<p><a href="/solutions/smile/">Smile 6</a> is, of course, the next step in our journey to build the world’s best automated billing platform. It took a bit longer than we had hoped, and I take full responsibility for the delays – but I hope you will agree with me that it was worth the wait. Smile 6 is by far the most complex and important upgrade we’ve ever achieved, and it provides a significant new technical foundation for your current and future billing system needs.</p>
<p>Our biggest customer success story of the year was the deployment of our cloud product, Smile Pro, into&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ultrafastfibre.co.nz/">Ultrafast Fibre</a>. UFF is one of New Zealand’s largest fibre broadband wholesalers.</p>
<p>We’re super proud of our achievements with UFF. Following the signing of the Smile contract, the first successful billing run took just&nbsp;<strong>56 days – “soup to nuts”</strong>&nbsp;– a huge effort for both companies. Compared to their previous automated billing platform, we’ve reduced the invoice processing time by&nbsp;<strong>144 hours per month</strong>, allowed UFF to increase order throughput to&nbsp;<strong>7,000 orders per month</strong>&nbsp;(the majority of which are new services added to Smile software), we’ve helped&nbsp;<strong>increase staff productivity by 255%,</strong>&nbsp;and UFF has been able to reduce both billing and human errors. We’re so excited about this that we put together an&nbsp;<a href="/?p=2368&amp;preview=true">infographic</a>&nbsp;to share with you.</p>
<p>Finally – and most importantly – I want to take this opportunity to shout out to all our customers, vendors, friends and Significant Others: you are the people who make Inomial the company it is today; we sincerely thank you for your ongoing support.</p>
<p>On behalf of the whole team at Inomial, may you have a happy, safe and peaceful Christmas – and a prosperous 2017!</p>

<p>You can configure Smile software to reconcile the payments it has recorded with your payment gateway(s). It will ensure that payments recorded in Smile and other payment handlers match. If errors or mis-matches are identified Smile will report a reconciliation failure, which can be investigated.</p>
