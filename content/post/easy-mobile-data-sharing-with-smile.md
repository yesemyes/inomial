<p>In Smile, it’s easy to create products where multiple devices all draw from a single, shared pool of data and/or call allowances. This style of billing is common in the US market and is catching on in Australia. Smile has supported this feature for many years.</p>
<p>For network operators and layer 2 MVNOs, Smile also supports shared policy management; Smile can automatically apply overage policies (such as traffic shaping, call restriction, or walled gardens) to all of the devices which share a given allowance. Smile can, of course, also charge for overages where required.</p>
<p>Smile fully supports the Australian TCP code for shared data plans – in fact, any of Smile’s extensive billing or policy features that can be applied to a single device allowance can also apply to a shared allowance.</p>
<p>Shared allowances can also be handy for operators providing network access across multiple network types, such as a monthly data allowance shared between ADSL and Wifi networks. Smile has extensive support for the subtleties of this kind of arrangement.</p>
<p>Finally, Smile supports multi-tiered allowances. For example, each of the 5 devices used by a hypothetical business customer could draw from a shared pool of usage (say, 5 GB per month), but no single device might be entitled to draw more than its own maximum usage allowance (say, 2 GB). If a single device’s allowance is exceeded, only that device is affected; if the shared pool is used up, all devices are affected. Allowances can be nested to any depth, allowing (for example) device, branch, state and total allowances – for incredible flexibility when dealing with large customers.</p>
<p>Configuration and use of these standard Smile features is straightforward. Contact us now for more information.</p>
