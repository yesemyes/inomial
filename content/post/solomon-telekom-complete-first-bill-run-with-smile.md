<p>Today <a href="https://www.ourtelekom.com.sb" target="_blank">Solomon Telekom</a> completed their first bill run for mobile, fixed and internet services using Smile software, Inomial’s real-time integrated accounting, provisioning, help desk and customer relationship management CRM system.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to help Solomon Telekom achieve this milestone. Not only has our partnership with Solomon Telekom provided a solution to meet their expanding needs, but Smile billing is also adding value for their customers,” said Mark Lillywhite, Inomial’s Managing Director.</p>
<p>Solomon Telekom selected Inomial’s Smile software as their revenue management and automated billing solution to replace their legacy billing systems that was over 15 years old and more suited to the fixed network environment.</p>
<p>“A new automated billing system was an important investment for Solomon Telekom because our current customer information system CIS has reached end of life, with support unlikely after July 2016,” said Loyley Ngira,Solomon Telekom Chief Executive.</p>
<p>“We wanted a billing system that could not only bill for what we have today, but also we want to be able to bill for future services,” he added, noting that Solomon Telekom, which uses the “Our Telekom” brand, was also introducing a range of new services including IPTV.</p>
<p>Inomial’s <a href="/solutions/smile/">Smile billing solution</a> gives Solomon Telekom a modern flexible automated billing system that will enable them to offer multiple products and services along with the ability to bill all services and products extracted from call data records with revenue assurance. Billing that was previously a time-consuming manual process is now fast and automated. “A good reason to Smile” says Loyley Ngira.</p>
<p>From today Solomon Telekom customers will receive clear and simplified bills&nbsp;with account overviews and graphical summaries. This is the first of a number of powerful new features that will be introduced by Solomon Telekom through their use of Smile software. Future features include an online customer portal, the ability for customers to download their invoices and access for customers to personally manage their usage and spend.</p>
