<p>New in Smile 6 are office locations. Office locations are a list of physical locations. These locations identify the location of a Smile software operator or a sale location of an invoice line item.</p>
<h3>Smile operator location</h3>
<p>A Smile operator’s location is set in their operator account profile. The selected location will be used as the default when the operator creates invoice line items.</p>
<p>Capabilities determine if an operator can change their default location or the location of other operators.</p>
<p>The following screenshot displays an example of locations available to a logged in Smile operator in the Smile software Menu Bar.</p>

<h3>Transaction item location</h3>
<p>When an operator creates an invoice line item the location is automatically populated from the operator’s default. The operator may optionally change a location if there is more than one location to choose from and the operator has the capability to do so.</p>
<p>The following screenshot of the Smile software&nbsp;Add Item window displays the sale location field.</p>
