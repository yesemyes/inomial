<p>Linking help desk tickets lets you associate&nbsp;tickets that have a similar cause or subject. For example, if a customer has a recurring ADSL problem, you can link the tickets of each instance of the problem together. Linking tickets helps you easily refer to information in other tickets so you can determine common problems or trends or see what actions have already been taken.</p>
<h2>Instructions for Linking Tickets in Smile Software</h2>
