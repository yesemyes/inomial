<p>Our biggest customer success story of the year was the deployment of our cloud product, <a href="/solutions/smile/">Smile Pro</a>, into&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ultrafastfibre.co.nz/">Ultrafast Fibre</a>. UFF is one of New Zealand’s largest fibre broadband wholesalers.</p>
<p>We’re super proud of our achievements with UFF. Following the signing of the Smile contract, the first successful billing cycle run took just&nbsp;<strong>56 days – “soup to nuts”</strong>&nbsp;– a huge effort for both companies. Compared to their previous billing platform, we’ve reduced the invoice processing time by&nbsp;<strong>144 hours per month</strong>, allowed UFF to increase order throughput to&nbsp;<strong>7,000 orders per month</strong>&nbsp;(the majority of which are new services added to Smile), we’ve helped&nbsp;<strong>increase staff productivity by 255%,</strong>&nbsp;and UFF has been able to reduce both billing and human errors.</p>
