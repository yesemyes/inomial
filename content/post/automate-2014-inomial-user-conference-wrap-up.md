<p>We held our inaugural User Conference in Melbourne on June 10 and 11. We think it went well, with attendance of partners from across Australia and the Pacific Islands, so we are keen to share with you what we covered, particularly our plans for the future.</p>
<p>We’d also like to hear more from you and what you need. We took note of your comments during the conference, but you can keep the conversation going with us or each other in our <a href="/newsletter/inomial-document-repository-users/">User Forum</a>.</p>

<p>For those of that you that could make it, this is a bit of a recap and reference. For those that couldn’t, we hope you find this summary useful too. The presentations themselves are also available online in the <a href="/document-library/">Document Repository</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a snapshot of what we covered: <a href="http://us3.campaign-archive2.com/?u=59da774bd029eb6c22f2fb236&amp;id=9ab7f8e0ad&amp;e=">Automate 2014 Wrap-Up</a>.
