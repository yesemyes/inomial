<p>“…there’s still many opportunities for smaller players to be involved in [the greenfield deployment] market,” Platform Networks managing director David Hooton said.</p>
<p>“We have an agreement with Comverge to assist them in developing their retail service provider channel. We’re doing service delivery, they’re doing the [network] building.”</p>
<p>Platform Networks was recently named the only wholesale-only participant in mainland NBN first release sites, bolstering its NBN credentials.</p>
<p>Hooton said he and Comverge were “very keen to hear from any greenfields developers”.</p>
